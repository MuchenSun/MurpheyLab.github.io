We have received a [DARPA OFFSET](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/offensive-swarm-enabled-tactics) award "Interaction and Perception: Multi-Source Spectral Framework for Human-Swarm Collaboration" in collaboration with Siemens to develop algorithms that enable swarms to support human perception.
