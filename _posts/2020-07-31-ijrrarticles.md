Two papers recently came out in the [International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/ijr).  Alex Broad and [Ian Abraham](https://murpheylab.github.io/people/ianabraham)  wrote <i>Data-driven Koopman operators for model-based shared control of human-machine systems </i> along with our awesome collaborator Brenna Argall (ME/CS/Shirley Ryan Ability Lab).  And [Katie Fitzsimons](https://murpheylab.github.io/people/katiefitzsimons) and [Ola Kalinowska](https://murpheylab.github.io/people/olakalinowska) wrote <i>Task-based hybrid shared control for training through forceful interaction</i> along with another one of our amazing collaborators Jules Dewald (Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine). Congratulations to all of them!
