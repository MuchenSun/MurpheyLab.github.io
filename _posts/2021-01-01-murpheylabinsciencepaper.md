[Tommy Berrueta](https://murpheylab.github.io/people/thomasberrueta) and [Alex Samland](https://murpheylab.github.io/people/alexsamland) did terrific work for this [Science paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6524/90) and it was a pleasure to collaborate with the England, Goldman and Wiesenfeld labs.  We are proud to be part of this ongoing effort to understand emergent behavior in active matter and robotics.
