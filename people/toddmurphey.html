  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>Professor Murphey's research focuses on computational methods in dynamics
    and control, with applications in neuroscience, health science, robotics,
    and automation. The group focuses on computational models of embedded
    control, biomechanical simulation, dynamic exploration, and hybrid control.
    The mathematical approaches used by the group lead to many orders of
    magnitude improvement in computational efficiency for reliable real-time
    implementation. Applications include assistive exoskeleton control,
    stabilization of energy networks, bio-inspired active sensing, entertainment
    robots, robotic exploration, and software-enabled stroke rehabilitation. </p>

  <h3>Teaching</h3>
  <p>Professor Murphey has developed the ME 314 Machine Dynamics course,
    focusing on the application of variational analysis to simulation and
    design of mechanisms.  He has additionally developed ME 454, an introduction
    to numerical methods in optimal control and a class on active learning in robotics.  In 2013 he taught an online
    version of one of the Engineering Analysis courses as a Coursera Massive
    Open Online Course (MOOC) (more information can be found at <a href="https://nxr.northwestern.edu/coursera-eits">Coursera class
    Everything is the Same: Modeling Engineered Systems</a>).  In all these courses,
    Professor Murphey focuses on project-based learning.  He has been a featured
    speaker at the National Academy of Engineering Frontiers of Engineering
    Education Workshop (see his <a href="https://www.naefoee.org/8118.aspx">blog</a> here).</p>
