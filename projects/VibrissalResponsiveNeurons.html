  <br><p>We see because retinal ganglion cells respond to light. We hear because
    spiral ganglion cells respond to sound. We feel because primary somatosensory
    neurons respond to touch. But what is touch? Whereas light and sound can be
    characterized by physical parameters (amplitude, frequency, phase, and
    polarization), the mechanics of touch, and the manner in which primary sensory
    neurons encode the parameters of touch, are largely unquantified. This is a
    glaring gap within the entire field of somatosensation, and it occurs because
    mechanics are difficult to quantify. To close this gap we will use the rat
    vibrissal (whisker) system as a model to directly relate the responses of
    primary sensory neurons to the quantified mechanics of touch. Paralleling the
    increased use of rodents in genetic and optogenetic research, the rodent
    vibrissal array has become an increasingly important model for the study of
    touch and sensorimotor integration. </p>
