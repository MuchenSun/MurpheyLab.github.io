<p>We are interested in improving human-swarm team performance by including
the human directly into the control loop. While fully autonomous robotic
exploration requires less supervision, it neglects the operator’s intuition.
We have developed a shared control algorithm that leverages the capabilities
of the human and the swarm by. This project focuses on determining how
autonomy allocation affects exploration efforts, thus task performance of the
human-swarm collaboration.

Ongoing efforts utilize virtual reality (VR) environment build in Unity Software
and HTC VIVE headset before transferring to field tests. At the same time, we
are collecting biometric data such as eye gaze (Pupil Labs), EEG (Emotiv) and
EKG (SOMNOmedics) to determine operator’s cognitive state. </p>
