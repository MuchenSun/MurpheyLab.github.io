  <br><p>Most cyber-physical systems have operated in comparatively benign
    environments, often engineered to meet the needs of the system. For instance,
    in many settings robots operate in closed-off environments in manufacturing.
    However, as these systems are deployed in increasingly isolated environments
    (such as search and rescue efforts, automation in surgical devices,
    collaborative manufacturing) these robots will need to operate while
    reasoning about substantial uncertainty. Moreover, actions taken by the
    system impact that uncertainty. The proposed work will develop algorithms
    that enable a cyber-physical system to reason about what actions it must
    take to manage its uncertainty. A simple example of this is understanding
    that one must look behind and under things when searching for an object.
    The goal of this project is to automate the process of managing that
    uncertainty, however it arises. For instance, interacting with humans
    (such as physically interacting with a person while assisting her motion,
    or tracking a person during a search effort) involves uncertainty about what
    the person is going to do. Enabling a robotic system to actively test a
    person's intent, and then act according to her subsequent behavior, is key
    to the robot's ability to be an effective partner. This essential point,
    that action on the part of a cyber-physical system can be used to explicitly
    manage its understanding of the world, is the core purpose of the proposed work.</p>
